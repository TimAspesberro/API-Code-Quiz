# API Code Quiz

## User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score


## Project Description
This project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a timed quiz with a tracked highscore. The quiz starts when the user presses the 'Start Quiz' button, then the one minute timer starts. The user is presented with the first question and four multiple choice questions. There are four questions in total, if the user hits an incorrect answer, they are deducted 5 seconds of time. Once all four correct answers have been selected, your score is presented. If your score is better than the highscore in the top right corner, it will replace that score. My website includes all espects of the acceptance criteria except for the ability to include initials with your highscore.
